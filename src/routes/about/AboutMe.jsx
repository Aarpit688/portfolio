      <p className="white-text p-tag">
        With a strong academic foundation in computer applications and hands-on
        experience building full-stack projects, I'm stepping confidently into
        the world of web development. My journey has been defined by a passion
        for learning and a knack for problem-solving, sharpened through
        real-world projects like Ace Global Logistics and Refokus Clone.
        Equipped with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind, I
        craft responsive, user-focused interfaces and scalable backend
        solutions. Beyond code, I bring leadership experience and discipline
        shaped by roles like School Captain and NCC certification. What sets me
        apart is a balanced blend of technical ability and a user-first mindset,
        allowing me to create clean, engaging, and impactful web applications.
